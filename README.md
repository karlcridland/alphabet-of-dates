# Alphabet of Dates

Originally an app I'd made for my girlfriend in the week before her birthday. 
I'm now in the process of cleaning up the code and introducing a more readable architecture.

Features included in the application are:

- Authentication
- Image compression/uploads
- APNS notifications

What's still left to do: 

- [ ] clean up the basic app structure (originally only contained one screen which listed the alphabet of dates, need to restructure how that screen and others moving forward are shown)
- [x] improve image retention (images are re-downloaded every time a change happens, need to fix this)
- [x] finish authentication screen (makeshift auth was used for the initial application, a user friendly screen should be implemented)
- [ ] create set up page once user has signed in for the first time
